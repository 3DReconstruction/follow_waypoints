## Installation

```
  $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-follow-waypoints
```

## Usage

To set waypoints you can either publish a ROS `PoseWithCovarianceStamped` message to the `/initialpose` topic directly or use RVizâ€™s tool "2D Pose Estimate" to click anywhere. To visualize the waypoints as pink arrows in RViz, configure RViz to display the topic `/current_waypoints` which is published by `follow_waypoints` and must be subscribed to in Rviz as a `PoseAarray` type.

To initiate waypoint following send a "path ready" message.

```
  $ rostopic pub /path_ready std_msgs/Empty -1
```
